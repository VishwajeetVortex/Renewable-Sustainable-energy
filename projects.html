    <h1>Some Famous & Sucessful Renewable Energy Projects in the World</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>1. Huanghe Hydropower Hainan Solar Park, China</h2>
        <img src="https://renergyinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Huanghe-Hydropower-Hainan-Solar-Park-China.jpg"
            height="300px" width="500px">
            <br><br>
        China is the world leader when it comes to solar capacity, so it is fitting that the country is also home to the
        world’s largest solar park. Huanghe Hydropower Hainan Solar Park, also known as the Golmud Solar Park, is a 2.3
        GW solar project in the arid climate region of Qinghai Province.

        Huanghe is state-owned by Huanghe Hydropower Development and the project is aiming to reach a maximum solar
        capacity of 16 GW over the next few years. So far, more than USD2.2 billion has been invested into the solar
        park which was officially connected to the grid in 2020.

        <h2>2. Sweihan Photovoltaic Independent Power Project, UAE</h2>
        <img src="https://www.mepmiddleeast.com/cloud/2022/01/12/Sweihan-Noor-Abu-Dhabi-IPP.jpg" height="300px"
            width="500px">
            <br><br>
        The Sweihan Photovoltaic Independent Power Project is located in Sweihan, Abu Dhabi, and covers an area of 7.8
        square kilometers. The solar plant was developed by a joint venture of Marubeni Corporation, Junko Solar, and
        the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority with a total investment of USD870 million.

        The project uses an innovative module layout design, high-efficiency monocrystalline solar modules, and advanced
        project maintenance to ensure that the cost of power generation remains low. Commercial operations at the plant
        began in April 2019 and the latest figures show that it supplies power to more than 195,000 homes in the region.

        <h2>3. Bhadla Solar Park, India</h2>
        <img src="https://invest.rajasthan.gov.in/storage/app/public/photos/rajasthan-renewable-banner-1920.jpg"
            height="300px" width="500px">
            <br><br>

        Bhadla Solar Park is the world’s largest solar park located in India which is spread over a total area of 14,000
        acres in Bhadla, Phalodi tehsil, Jodhpur district, Rajasthan, India.
        The region has been described as “almost unlivable” due its climate. Average temperatures in Bhadla hover
        between 46 and 48 degrees Celsius. Hot winds and sand storms occur frequently. Bhadla is a sandy, dry and arid
        region with an area of about 45 km2.
        The Solar park has a total capacity of 2,245 MW.
        When its full capacity is operational, the park will become the world’s largest fully commissioned PV project,
        with investment rising to Rs 10,000 crore (US$1.3 billion).

        <h2>4. Three Gorges, China</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/20/119620-050-AC901996/Yichang-Three-Gorges-Dam-Yangtze-River-China.jpg"
            height="300px" width="500px">
            <br><br>
        Three Gorges is a 22.5 GW hydroelectric power plant in Yichang, China. It’s the world’s largest hydropower
        station and is a conventional impoundment facility that exploits the water resources of the Yangtze River to
        produce electricity.

        Construction of the USD29 billion Three Gorges facility began in 1993 and was completed almost 20 years later in
        2012. As part of the project, a 181 meter tall and 2,335-meter long gravity dam was built. The plant itself
        consists of 32 turbine units that are each rated over 700 MW, and two 50 MW power generators. The annual output
        of the hydroelectric plant is estimated to be around 85 TWh.

        <h2>5. Gansu Wind Farm, China</h2>
        <img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1dc2e286-2815-11e6-8b18-91555f2f4fde?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1"
            height="300px" width="500px">
            <br><br>
        Gansu Wind Farm, also known as the Jiuquan Wind Power Base, is in the west of China’s Gansu province on the
        outskirts of the Gobi Desert. It has a planned capacity of 20 GW making it one of the world’s largest, if not
        the largest, wind farms.
        The Gansu project is worth an estimated USD17.5 billion and comes as part of the Chinese government’s plans to
        invest USD360 billion into renewable energy sources. Phase one of the project was completed in 2010 with 3,500
        turbines installed.
        When the construction of the farm is complete, it will include more than 7,000 wind turbines and, in theory,
        produce enough energy to power a small country. At the time of writing this article, the farm has just under
        8,000 MW (8 GW) of installed capacity.

        <h2>6. Alta Wind Energy Centre, United States</h2>
        <img src="https://images.interestingengineering.com/1200x675/images/FEBRUARY/wind-farm.jpg" height="300px"
            width="500px">
            <br><br>
        The Alta Wind Energy Centre, also known as the Mojave Wind Farm, is located in the Tehachapi Pass of the
        Tehachapi Mountains, in Kern County, California. With an installed capacity of 1,550 MW, it is the largest wind
        farm in the United States and there are plans to increase this capacity to 3,000 MW in the future.

        The Mojave Wind Farm was originally developed by Terra-Gen Power and construction began in July 2010 and wrapped
        up in 2013. The project initially aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 5.2 million metric tonnes and
        generate power for 275,000 residences in California. Today, it supplies around 1,500 MW to Southern California
        Edison, the primary electricity supplier for most of Southern California.

        <h2>7. Hornsea One, United Kingdom</h2>
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://centurionlg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-06-at-12.53.13-1024x474.png"
            height="300px" width="500px">
        Hornsea One is the world’s largest and most famous offshore wind farm located off the Yorkshire coast with a
        total capacity of 1.2 GW. It was the world’s first offshore wind farm to surpass 1 GW in installed capacity. The
        wind farm covers 407 square kilometers and is made up of 174 Siemens turbines with a capacity of 7 MW each.

        Hornsea One officially became operational in early 2020 and produces enough energy to power more than 1 million
        UK homes. The project is owned 50-50 by both Ørsted and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and is part of an
        USD8.7 billion investment to transform the Humber region into a renewable energy hub.
